# ‚úÖ Connection Fixed!

## The Problem Was:
The app was trying to connect to `localhost:5001`, which doesn't exist on the second computer.

## The Solution:
Now the app uses your network IP: **`10.21.145.113:5001`**

## How to Connect on Second Computer (EASIEST WAY)

### Step 1: Make sure both computers are on the same WiFi

### Step 2: On Computer 2, open a browser and go to:

```
http://10.21.145.113:3000
```

**That's it!** You should now see:
- üü¢ Green "Connected" indicator
- The current counter value
- "Server: http://10.21.145.113:5001" displayed

### Step 3: Test it!

1. Click "Increment Counter" on Computer 2
2. Watch it update on Computer 1 (your Mac)
3. Click "Increment Counter" on Computer 1
4. Watch it update on Computer 2!

## What Changed:

**Before:**
```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:5001')  // ‚ùå Only works on this computer
```

**After:**
```javascript
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5001'
const socket = io(API_URL)  // ‚úÖ Uses network IP from .env.local
```

**Created `.env.local` file:**
```
VITE_API_URL=http://10.21.145.113:5001
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still showing "üî¥ Disconnected"?

**Check 1: Firewall**
On your Mac (Computer 1), check if firewall is blocking connections:
```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate

# If enabled, allow Node
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/node
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblockapp /usr/local/bin/node
```

**Check 2: Can Computer 2 reach the server?**
From Computer 2, open terminal and test:
```bash
# Ping the server
ping 10.21.145.113

# Test the API
curl http://10.21.145.113:5001/api/counter
```

If curl returns `{"success":true,"count":...}` then the server is reachable!

**Check 3: Browser Console**
On Computer 2, press F12 (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect) and check the Console tab.
Look for any error messages.

**Check 4: Correct URL**
Make sure the page shows: "Server: http://10.21.145.113:5001"
If it says "Server: http://localhost:5001" the .env.local didn't load properly.

### IP Address Changed?

If you restart your Mac or reconnect to WiFi, your IP might change.

Get the new IP:
```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

Update `.env.local`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_NEW_IP:5001
```

Restart the servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ Backend running on port 5001
‚úÖ Frontend running on port 3000
‚úÖ Socket.IO configured for network access
‚úÖ Environment variable using network IP
‚úÖ Multiple clients can connect

The app is ready! Just have Computer 2 browse to **http://10.21.145.113:3000**
